Experimental Application Development Platform
==============================================

Experimental platform for building large multi-language, distributed applications. 

The primary goal is to the ease the barier to entry and provide developers with a quick and easy way to get up and running with the entire platform, with a minimum of installed dependencies and working knowledge. This project utilizes a task runner to script out complex workflows and provide a simple command-line interface. 

**Requirements:**
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
* [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev)

# Getting Started

You can build, package and run the entire solution with `up`.

```shell
$ task up
```

# Docker Compose

## Development Overrides

All services can be overridden by editing the `docker-compose.local.yml` file. This allows you to enable development & debugging utilities on a service-by-service basis. Developers are able to customize their environment to focus their development efforts on a small part of the platform 

> ðŸš€ Developer overrides are **local only** and are excluded from commits by the `.gitignore` file.


### Example

In this example, uncommenting the `shipyard_worker` section enables hot-reloading and Visual Studio debugging of the `Shipyard.Worker` dotnet core application. The solution source root is mapped to the image as a mounted volume so that the docker container can monitor the file system for changes. Developer user secrets are also mounted to provide safe storage of secrets via the `dotnet user-secrets` tool.

**docker-compose.local.yml:**
```yml
version: '3'

services:
  shipyard_worker:
    image: shipyard-worker:dev
    build: 
      dockerfile: src/Shipyard.Worker/Dockerfile.develop
    volumes:
      - ./sources/shipyard/src/:/app/src/        
      - $APPDATA/Microsoft/UserSecrets/:/root/.microsoft/usersecrets/
      - $HOME/.microsoft/usersecrets/:/root/.microsoft/usersecrets/
```
